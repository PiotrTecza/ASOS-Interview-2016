Tools:
Visual Studio 2015 - .Net Framework 4.5
Nuget packages will be downloaded automatically during the build

Projects:
App - 	I didn't manage to prepare proper projects separation (business layer, data acces layer etc.), only created folders
	to group files. I didn't change namespaces of existing files. 

	Main architectural changes:
	- extracting credit strategies
	- creating CustomerRepository to encapsulate CustomerDataAccess.
	- making CustomerDataAccess obsolete - a way to remove static class in the future
	- moving Customer validation logic to the NewCustomer class(DDD and Animic Domain Model)
	- created factory responsible for creating CustomerCreditServiceClient

	Next steps:
	- separating domain and data acces code
	- creating mappings between domain and data access models
	- moving validation logic out of repository
	- covering all public methods with Unit Tests	

App.IntegrationTests - because legacy code came without any tests, my first step was to create integration test to be sure that after
	the refactoring everything works as originally. This test was maintained and changed accordingly during the refactoring. Can be 
	removed once refactoring is done.

App.UnitTests - I have managed to test only CustomerService, as my main focus was to have proper and maintained integration test
